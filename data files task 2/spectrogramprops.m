function [Spec_image,labels] = spectrogramprops(Clipping,Hamming,TW,OF,Te,Diff,Comb1,Comb2,Comb3,Comb4,Comb5,Comb6)

%This is a combination function in order to 
%a)extract, select and fuse features from radar data.
%b)adjust the parameters and give a 10-fold cross validation error rate to
%evaluate the parameters.

%Before running the program, make sure that 'natsortfile.m' has been added
%to the MATLAB path or is in the same folder.

%The FOLLOWING PARAMETERS have been added
%                        
%  'Clipping'            This is the clipping factor of the spectrogram, 
%                        The spectrogram would be clipped according to its time axis. 
%                        This factor is between 0 (No clippling), 1.5(clipping with 1.5s), 
%                        3(Clipping with 3s) and 5(Clipping with 5s). 
%  'Hamming'             This factor decides whether the hamming window will 
%                        be used or not. Hamming == 1 means using hamming window,
%                        other input number means Hamming window will not be used.
%  'TW'                  Time window lenght factor decides the time window length 
%                        in STFT of the spectrogram. There are five options: 150
%                        300,450,600,750.Range:[100 1000]
%  'OF'                  The overlap factor is also used in STFT process. 
%                        The default value is 0.95 and it is
%                        adjustable.Range[0.5 0.95]
%  'Te'                  An interger between -10 to 20.This is the thresholding factor. 
%                        The adaptive thresholding method can calculate a threshold T
%                        This T can be changed (add or minus) to improve
%                        the accuracy of classification.[T-20 T+20]                      
%  'Diff'                This factor is used in adaptive thresholding method calculation
%                        to determine the thresholding value. The default input 
%                        value should be 0.1. [0.01 1]
%  'Comb1-6'             Comb 1 to Comb 6 are correspoding to features of mask, 
%                        masked phase, maske unwrapped phase, masked spectrogram 
%                        image,spectrogram and masked spetrogram, these six
%                        different types of features. Input 1 means correspoding 
%                        types of feature will be used, Input 0 means it will 
%                        not be used..

% There are 443 variables in this function in total.
% Example: Spec_image = spectrogramprops(0,1,256,0.95,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,0);
% This means human data is chosen and the spectrogram has no clippinig. The
% Hamming window is used and time windwo length is 150ms, with 0.95 overlap
% factor.The final thresholding value is the adaptive thresholding method
% result with 0.1 difference. 6 different types of features are used (Comb1
% to Comb6).
